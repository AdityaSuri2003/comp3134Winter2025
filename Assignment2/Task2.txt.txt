By guaranteeing that information sent between a client and server is jumbled using cryptographic techniques, encryption guards against disclosure. Since HTTP transmits data in unencrypted, it is susceptible to interception. To stop hackers from reading private data, HTTPS encrypts traffic using TLS (Transport Layer Security). Credentials, session cookies, and other private information are protected against sniffer attacks when a website use HTTPS.
