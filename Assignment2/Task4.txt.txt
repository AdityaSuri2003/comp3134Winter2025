Organisations and individuals can take a number of precautions to protect themselves from ARP spoofing attacks. First, activating Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on managed network switches helps to avoid malicious ARP responses by checking IP-to-MAC mappings. Second, manually configuring static ARP entries for key devices such as routers and servers can help prevent ARP poisoning. Third, adopting encrypted communication technologies such as HTTPS, SSH, and VPNs ensures that intercepted traffic stays unreadable. Finally, implementing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and network monitoring tools such as ARPwatch can assist administrators in detecting and alerting to unusual ARP activity. Implementing these measures can dramatically reduce ARP spoofing risks, resulting in a secure network environment.
